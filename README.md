Once the application is running, you can access it in your browser at `http://localhost:5500`. Use the provided features to register, log in, browse coffee products, and place orders.

## Environment Variables

The project uses the `dotenv` package to manage environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:

SECRET_KEY="Your secret key for your tokens"
DATABASE_KEY="Your database password"
SENDGRID_API_KEY = "Your API key for your email orders (using SendGrid)"
